Travel Logic Module

This module contains the business logic for finding optimal travel plans.
It handles timing constraints between flights and hotels, ensuring the traveler
has sufficient time to get from the airport to their hotel.

Key functions:
- extract_arrival_datetime: Parse flight arrival time into datetime
- filter_valid_hotels: Filter hotels that meet timing constraints
- find_cheapest_plan: Find the cheapest flight + hotel combination
